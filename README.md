# chatmodels

This repository contains a model file used by instances of the TUBAF-IFI-CHATBOT. 

The model file is periodically updated by the prompt engineers. It is always named `model.tar.gz`.

The `production` directory contains the docker, docker-compose and configuration files to build and run a dockerized Chatbot server. 
See `production/README.md` for build & run commands.
